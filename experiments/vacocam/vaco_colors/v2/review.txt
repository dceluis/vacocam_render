What was done:
I assigned completely random colors

What whas observed:
Confirmed the bias towards the blue being selected as primary.
Pumpkin also has a negative bias.
Blue seems to be associated with "correct" and Pumpkin with "incorrect"
I think its because since these are the two first matplotlib colors they might have biased the visual model.

What I also noticed in this experiment is that letters might also have a bias.
With A being marked as primary most of the times. B and C less so. D and later letters mostly marked as secondary.

Next steps:
Remove blue and pumpkin from the palette of colors, and evaluate the distribution of primary among the remaining colors
Randomize letters as well, to see if the bias is with the letters or, on the contraty, with the fact that the biggest clusters
tend to be assigned letters first.
Easier: Maybe stop using letters and markers and use numbers instead?
