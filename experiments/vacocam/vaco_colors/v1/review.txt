This version is heavily skewed towards blue being the primary cluster

Maybe its because we are comparing "blue" vs "pumpkin", and calling pumpkin orange might improve the results

The blue bias seems to be consistent.
By accident, the code submitted the cluster pairs twice: one for pair A - B and once for B - A, with only the colors switched.
