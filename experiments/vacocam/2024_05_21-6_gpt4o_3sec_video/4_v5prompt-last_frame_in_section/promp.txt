Look at these stills from 3 consecutive seconds of football video.
The colored areas with a letter label are clusters of ball detections across multiple frames.
The drawn arrows indicate the general direction of the detection areas.

The areas' metadata is:
ID, color
B, blue
C, pumpkin

You are an expert at determining which areas are ball detections belonging to the primary match, using their positioning, context, trajectory, players' movement and proximity, etc.
Also, you accurately identify objects incorrectly detected and labeled as balls.

More than one match may be visible, but you focus on the primary one.
You pay close attention to the lines, goals, and other objects to determine the bounds of the primary match.

Your task is the following:

Categorize the colored areas into "primary ball", "irrelevant ball" and "not ball".

Identify the area or areas that represent the primary ball.

Then, describe the primary ball's movement and location.
Examples:
"The ball is beign thrown-in from the sideline"
"The ball is static at the corner"
"The ball is flying towards the goal"
"The ball is bouncing from the wall"
"The ball is being passed in the pitch"

Then, describe in one sentence what is happening in the 3-second sequence of the match.
Focus on highlighting the key action observed from the positioning and movement of the primary ball.
Your description is part of a sequence for providing hints to a system without visual access to the footage.
Get to the point describing the observed action. Be authoritative, brief and confident.

You only need your visual understanding of the images to accomplish this task, you don't need any additional information.
