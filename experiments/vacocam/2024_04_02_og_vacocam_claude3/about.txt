this experiment runs the exact original configuration but with claude3-haiku instead of gpt4-vision-preview.

Results:

* The vision capabilities SEEM slightly degraded. INCONCLUSIVE
* The cost is very reduced, about 10 times less expensive to run on claude3 haiku than the original gpt4 vision.


Less accuracy for more recall (since we can run vision on more frames, given the reduced cost)
